# Intro_to_Java_Final_Project
This project is a basic Hangman game. There is a set list of words that the program will choose from to be the random word. 
Each word contains six letters to help with replayability.
As the user inputs characters, the screen will output the basic gallows and man and will display the correct letters.

This project is being created for my Java class through Sophia.
